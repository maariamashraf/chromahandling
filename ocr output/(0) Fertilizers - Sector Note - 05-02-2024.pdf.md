change quickly and unpredictably, rapidly altering its dynamics. These factors include escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, fluctuating weather patterns, a faster transition towards environmentally friendly fertilizers, potential logistical disruptions, and trade policy changes. These factors can affect the production, distribution, and consumption of fertilizers, as well as their prices and the profitability of their producers. Therefore, it is important to monitor these factors closely due to their significant impact on market trends. Market Dynamics Demand: Key Importers Shifting to Self-Reliance Global Demand for Urea Drivers: The two main factors that drive urea demand are the growing need for crop production to feed a rising population and the diverse industrial applications of urea. However, global demand has been recently subdued, mainly due to a decline in imports from key importing nations. In this section, we will analyze the demand drivers and trends for two major urea importers: India and Brazil. India: Declining Imports & Rising Domestic Production: India is the world's largest urea importer and one of the fastest-growing populations. However,

domestic production which has been on a noticeable upward trajectory throughout 2022 and 2023, reaching a record high of 31.1mn tons in 2023. This shift can be largely attributed to growing concerns regarding the reliability of China, the world's leading exporter, in light of its current urea export restrictions that have been imposed since 2022. India, along with other countries, has been exploring alternative sources and increasing its self-reliance in urea production. Brazil: Currency & Weather Fluctuations Hasten Self-Reliance: Brazil is the world's second-largest urea importer, taking in 7.3mn tons in 2023. However, Brazil's urea imports are expected to decrease in 2024, mainly due to currency fluctuations and lower corn production. The National Supply Company of Brazil (CONAB), which is responsible for managing the country's food supply, revised its forecast for the next soybean and corn harvests downward due to adverse weather in key growing regions.

## Sector Note 5 February 2024

Brazil's urea imports recorded 7.3mn tons in 2023, declining from its recent peak of 7.8mn in 2021. In the long term, the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply (MAPA) initiated a strategy in March 2022 to reduce Brazil's dependence on imported fertilizers by 2050, with a specific focus on boosting domestic production of nitrogenous fertilizers like urea.

recent years which inflated prices to unprecedented levels. Some of the myriad challenges were the Covid pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Russia's export quotas and duties, and China's export restrictions. These challenges have created a global urea supply shortage, as well as opportunities for other countries to increase their production and reduce their dependence on imports. In this section, we will analyze these supply challenges and opportunities in detail and how they affected urea prices. Covid: Disrupted Supply Chains: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in global supply chains and the transportation of urea, creating an initial wave of instability. The lockdowns, travel restrictions, and health measures affected the production, distribution, and consumption of urea, as

ally, Belarus. This had a negative effect on global urea supply, as Russia and Belarus were among the top fertilizer exporters. The two countries combined accounted for nearly 18% of the global trade in 2022 in the three major types of fertilizers, namely nitrogen, phosphate, and potash. The sanctions and bans have also increased the political and economic risks for the urea market, with the resulting uncertainty leading to volatility in the prices of this critical commodity. Russia's Export Quotas & Duties: Distorted Global Supply: Russia has also imposed quotas on some of its fertilizer exports in late 2021 to protect the local market from high prices and supply shortages. These quotas were

supposed to be temporary but have been extended several times, with the current one due to expire at the end of May 2024. The government has also implemented flexible export duties on fertilizers of up to 10% tied to the Russian Ruble FX rate to shield the domestic market. These measures have reduced global urea supply and put upward pressure on prices, as well as created incentives for other countries to increase their production and selfreliance. China's Export Restrictions: Dented Global Supply: China's export restrictions have resulted in a significant contraction of approximately 55% in the total fertilizer exports in 2022 from the world's leading exporter, compared to the average of the years 2019 to 2021. China has imposed these restrictions to conserve its domestic resources and support its local market. While there has been a slight recovery in the first eight months of 2023, these figures still lag considerably behind the average for the same period from 2019 to 2021. China's export restrictions have created a gap in global urea supply and placed further upward pressure on prices. Supply Outlook: Price Moderation & Increased Supply: We see that these trade policies from leading global exporters are likely to provide support for urea prices in 2024. However, we anticipate a moderation in urea prices

or by boosting their export potential.

Energy: Geopolitical Tensions & Natural Gas Prices Volatility Natural gas (or coal in the case of China) is the main raw material used in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizer. Urea production costs are largely determined by the price of natural gas, which accounts for about 70% of the total cost. Urea prices are also strongly influenced by natural gas prices, with

consumption levels.

Supply Factors: More LNG Exports to Europe: The gas price normalization trend was also driven by an increase in gas supply to Europe. US LNG exports increased by 8% in the first three quarters of 2023, reaching a record of 3,149 Tcf. About two-thirds of these exports were destined for Europe, to make up for the decline in gas supplies from Russia after it was hit with sanctions. Furthermore, there was an increase in LNG production in the Middle East, as the region sought to take advantage of the market situation and increase its global market share. These factors resulted in higher European gas inventory levels than the historical averages. Geopolitical Tensions: <sup>A</sup> Source of Volatility & Uncertainty: The natural gas market faced a period of high volatility in 2023, with European natural gas

prices spiking to USD16.62/MMBtu on 13 October 2023. This was mainly due to the conflict in the Middle East, a region that holds a large share of the global energy market. Furthermore, the recent clashes near the strategically crucial Bab al-Mandab Strait in the Red Sea have added to the geopolitical tension, as this passageway is a vital link for global supply chains. Any escalation in this region could potentially exert a profound impact on the prices of natural gas and other commodities, including urea.

operational by January 2026, and has already begun its transitional phase in October 2023. The CBAM is expected to have a significant impact on the competitiveness of fertilizer exporters to the EU, especially those who have not taken adequate measures to reduce their carbon emissions. The CBAM would require them to pay a price for the carbon content of their products, which could make them less attractive in the EU market compared to the domestic producers who are subject to the EU ETS (the Emission Trading System).

energy sources to reduce its environmental impact and enhance its profitability. Watch Factors Industry Trade Policies & Legislation: When following the fertilizers market, it is critical to keep an eye on trade policies

Therefore, the CBAM could create an incentive for fertilizer exporters to adopt more environmentally friendly practices in their production processes, or risk losing their market share in China Lags in Green Fertilizer Production: China is a major player in the global fertilizer market and is the world's foremost fertilizer exporter. However, China appears to be lagging in adopting environmentally sustainable methods in its fertilizer production. The pace and extent of their efforts towards eco-friendly practices seem to be insufficient in comparison to developed countries. This could pose a challenge for China in maintaining its competitive edge in the international market, especially in light of the CBAM and other IFC's Green Partnership with the Fertilizer Industry: On a related note, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is among the global entities collaborating with fertilizer manufacturers to reduce the industry's carbon emissions. In 2023, the IFC provided a EUR100mn green loan to the OCP group in Morocco, the world's leading producer of phosphatebased fertilizers. This funding is intended for the construction of four solar power plants, which will supply cost-efficient energy for the manufacture of low-carbon fertilizers. This is an example of how the fertilizer industry can leverage renewable a competitive advantage for EU fertilizer producers and a pressure for non-EU producers to decarbonize or diversify their markets. It will also have a varied impact on the global demand and supply of natural gas and electricity, as well as across different types of fertilizers, depending on their carbon intensity and the availability of low-carbon alternatives. Weather Conditions & Changing Patterns: The fertilizer market is intricately linked to weather patterns, as they can affect crop yields, demand, pricing, and trade volumes of fertilizers. For instance, Brazil's soybean planting has been delayed this season due to dry weather and high temperatures, which also affects the secondary corn crop. As a result, Brazil's corn production forecast has dropped by 10% compared to the previous season. This will influence crop prices and planting patterns, which will in turn affect the fertilizer market. Weather shifts can also change energy consumption patterns, especially for heating and cooling. This directly affects energy prices, particularly natural gas, which is a key input for fertilizer production. Extreme and changing weather conditions such as a very hot summer or a very cold winter could increase the demand and price of natural gas, especially when there is a gas supply shortage, which would raise the cost of urea production. With accelerating global warming and its escalating environmental impact, the frequency and intensity of weather extremes are projected to rise. Middle East Geopolitical Tensions: The recent geopolitical

tensions in the Middle East in early October caused a spike in natural gas prices, which increased by more than 25% from

and related legislation, as they can influence the current and future state of supply and demand, as well as the market structure and sustainability. For instance, China's export restrictions are compelling nations reliant on Chinese fertilizers to increase their domestic production in a step that could potentially reshape market dynamics and improve market sustainability going forward. Another example is the European Gas Demand Reduction Plan, which is leading to a more diversified natural gas market, which in turn could potentially lead to a more stable fertilizer industry. Lastly, the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will significantly reconfigure the fertilizers market, as it will create September to October of 2023. However, by December the prices started to stabilize and return to the normal range as the energy supply recovered. The average gas price for 2023 was still much lower than that of 2022, dropping by over 65%. However, any escalation of the current conflict poses a significant threat to global commodity markets, especially the energy sector. The region is a major source of energy for the world, and any disruption in the supply could have serious consequences. Furthermore, the disturbances near the strategically vital Bab al-Mandab Strait in the Red Sea could exacerbate the situation, leading to more adverse effects. The potential rise in energy prices, including natural gas, and possible supply interruptions could potentially instigate a surge in the price of fertilizers.

Egyptian Fertilizer Industry Overview: Export-Driven & Gas-Dependent: The fertilizer industry in Egypt is an important component of the nation's export structure, with a remarkable 50% YoY growth in exports in 2022 to reach USD3.3bn. The industry relies heavily on natural gas as a key production input, making it highly sensitive to events.

Key Market Dynamics

selling locally at free market prices. Gas Price Adjustment & Quota Compliance: In December 2021, the

government approved a 50% hike in subsidized urea prices to EGP4,500/ton, reflecting rising natural gas prices. This followed an earlier decision to increase gas prices in October 2021, which reflects that the government is responsive to the changes in the cost of gas as a key input. It is worth mentioning that some producers did not have to supply the full 55% quota as a result of lower government demand, and therefore sold more than 45% of their output at free market prices or as exports. New Gas Pricing Policy: The Egyptian government used to subsidize the fertilizers industry by providing natural gas at a low fixed price of USD4.5/MMBtu. However, this policy has changed since 13 September 2022. prices as well, with a minimum price of USD4.5/MMBtu.

global macroeconomic trends, commodity fluctuations, and geopolitical USD Scarcity: Incentive for Fertilizer Exporters: The recent USD shortage in Egypt has put a spotlight on industries capable of generating hard currency income, including the fertilizer industry. This situation positions the industry to pressure policymakers to increase export quotas, leading to greater USD revenue for fertilizer producers. On the other hand, this could come at the expense of domestic fertilizer supply, which would put upward pressure on EGP Devaluation: Mixed Benefits for Fertilizer Players in 2024: We foresee favorable financial performance for fertilizer producers in 2024, driven by 0 50 100 150 200 Top 10 Arabian Natural Gas Producer in 2022 bcm

Recent Sector Updates Gas Supply Reduction Impact: Recently, Egypt was exposed to a gas supply shortage as a result of a number of reasons, one of which is the impact of the Gaza war. This resulted in the Egyptian government deciding to temporarily reduce gas supply to heavy-use industries like fertilizer producers. ABUK, MFPC, and EGCH disclosed that the gas supply reduction didn't impact them, as they rationed their gas use through the cutting period, as well as resorting to their strategic stock of ammonia. Then, within a week or two, the government resumed the gas supply. However, it is crucial to highlight that any prolonged future shortages could exert significant pressure on their production capabilities. Red Sea Tensions: Another impact of the Gaza war was the recent surge in attacks by the Houthis in Yemen on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. This poses a serious threat to the stability of the region and the security of global trade. Several shipping companies have already halted their operations in the area, resulting in significant delays, costs, and uncertainty in international markets. This situation will exert upward pressure on gas prices, which in turn could adversely affect fertilizer producers by increasing their gas costs.

Urea Export Average Price Subsidized Urea Price in Egypt • We anticipate a steady increase in domestic subsidized prices, with an expected price of EGP7,145/ton by the end of 2028. Main Assumptions and Valuation Risks Given the nature of the industry, the peers we have chosen for evaluation share a lot of influential assumptions and evaluation risks. We have chosen to present these common factors separately to avoid repetition in each company's section. We also acknowledge that there are minor variations between companies within these common assumptions, primarily due to differing financial periods (fiscal year versus calendar year). These variations have been duly factored into our forecasts.

### Abu Qir Fertilizers

Business Summary Abu Qir Fertilizers & Chemicals Industries Company is recognized as an industry leader in the manufacturing and distribution of a wide range of nitrogenous, mixed, and liquid fertilizers. Additionally, it handles a variety of other chemicals and related materials essential for its production processes, and trades in them in both domestic and global markets. The company has 5 production facilities, namely Abu Qir Plant 1, Abu Qir Plant 2, Abu Qir Plant 3, the UAN Unit, and the Plastic Factory. Each of these units contributes to the diverse production capabilities of the company. The company's products include Prilled Urea, Prilled Urea treated with Zinc Sulphate, Granular Ammonium Nitrate, Granular Ammonium Nitrate Treated with Magnesium, Granular Urea, Granular Urea treated with Ammonium Sulphate, Granular Urea treated with Magnesium Sulphate, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN), and Liquid Ammonia. ABUK Operation New Gas Formula Impact: Natural gas was supplied to the company at a subsidized fixed price until the last Ministry of Petroleum decision. As of 13 September 2022, the Ministry of Petroleum decided that the price of natural gas supplied to nitrogen fertilizer producers will be calculated using a new pricing formula. This formula will be linked to the price of urea supplied to the government as well as actual export prices,

with a minimum gas price of USD4.5/MMBtu. With this new formula, gas costs rise concurrently with the price of exported urea. This exerts downward pressure on ABUK's profit margins compared to the earlier subsidized fixed price. It is important to note that gas costs account for around 60–70% of the company's production costs. In addition, the proportion of export sales also plays a role in gas pricing. As ABUK's export sales grow as a percentage of its total revenue, its cost of gas also increases proportionally. Subsidized Sales Proportion: As stipulated by the Egyptian government, fertilizer producers are required to allocate 55% of their production output to the government at a low compulsory procurement price. This quota is then distributed by the government to farmers at a subsidized price. As for the remaining 45%, the company is free to sell it at any price, whether domestically or internationally. It is worthy to mention that during the last fiscal year FY22/23, the government did not demand the full 55% quota from ABUK,

taking only 43% of its production at the compulsory price. This situation is highly likely to continue in the future, where the proportion of local sales at this low, compulsory price is below the 55% quota. Large Exports Revenue Stream: On the other hand, the company has a reliable stream of USD revenues, derived from exporting approximately 57% of its production in FY22/23. Its global footprint spans 24 countries, and it has successfully

established relationships with around 40 international customers. This would help ABUK maximize its revenues and FX gains in light of upcoming potential EGP devaluations. It is

worthy to mention that ABUK recorded around EGP4bn FX gain in FY22/23. Strong Cash Position is a Plus: Furthermore, as of 1Q23/24 ABUK boasted a robust liquidity status with a cash reserve of EGP14.5bn, complemented by EGP12bn worth of investments in Treasury Bills. This strong liquidity enables ABUK to leverage the current high-interest-rate environment, which is anticipated to rise further in 2024, thereby enhancing ABUK's profitability. It is worth noting that ABUK's treasury bills investments generated revenues of EGP1.2bn in FY22/23, contributing about 8% of the period's net profit. Future Expansions & Latest Updates Abu Qir 3 Plant Expansion: Recently, ABUK announced that it is still working on reviewing technical offers to boost the production of the Abu Qir 3 urea plant and cut down its carbon dioxide emissions. However, it is still unclear how this will exactly affect the production levels. In addition, ABUK also announced that it is currently preparing for an upcoming planned overhaul of the Abu Qir 1 plant, which is the company's oldest factory. North Abu Qir Project: ABUK holds a 45% stake in the North Abu Qir project, with the Egyptian General Petroleum

Corporation and the Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company owning 45% and 10%, respectively. The initial announcements indicate that the project will be situated on land owned by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, with the objective of producing 2,400 tons/day of ammonium nitrate, 1,200 tons/day of ammonia, and 1,830 tons/day of nitric acid. The project's estimated cost is USD1.2bn, and the company projects that it will be financed through a mix of 70% debt and 30% equity. However, in a recent development, ABUK has disclosed its intentions to transform North Abu Qir into a green project, with a focus on the production of green ammonia and ammonium nitrate. This transformation would involve using green hydrogen as the primary raw material, replacing the traditionally used natural gas. The commencement of the project's implementation will be announced upon the completion of these studies. Methanol Project: ABUK, a key player in the Methanol Project, holds a 35% stake. The remaining equity is distributed between Helwan Fertilizers Company and Al Ahly Capital Holding, with 35% and 30% stakes, respectively. It has been recently

revealed that the shareholders are strategizing to infuse an investment of USD1.6bn for the production of methanol, ammonia, and petrochemicals. However, further details regarding the progress of this development are yet to be disclosed.

### Abu Qir Fertilizers

Valuation & Recommendation We valued ABUK using our DCF-based model. Our value is based on a declining Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) over our forecast horizon. The FY23/24 WACC of 27.8% is calculated based on (1) US 5Y Treasury yield of 3.8%, (2) an inflation differential factor of 1.21, (3) EGY 6M CDs spread of 5.39%, (4) matured market equity risk premium ERP of 3.16%, and (5) 5Y Beta of 0.86. We expect a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. We reach a fair value of EGP70.21/share, which implies a downside potential of 23% based on ABUK's

Business Summary MFPC Operation Misr Fertilizers Production (Mopco)

devaluation.

Misr Fertilizer Production Company, Mopco, is one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer companies in Egypt. It was established in 1998 in the public free zone of Damietta, spanning an area of 400 thousand square meters. It primarily specializes in the production of urea, supplemented by ammonia, which serves as an intermediate product. Mopco produces approximately 2mn tons a year of urea, and the production process primarily relies on natural gas. Unique Natural Gas Formula: Similar to its local peers, the natural gas is provided to the company at a cost formula that is Strong Cash Position Supports Bottom-Line: As per the 3Q23 financial statements, MFPC is in a strong financial position with a cash reserve of EGP12.7bn. This substantial cash and cash equivalents position empowers MFPC to take advantage of the existing high-interest-rate environment, which is expected to see a further increase in 2024, consequently boosting MFPC's profit margins. The company has also disclosed an interest income of EGP780mn for the period covering the first three quarters of 2023. Future Expansions & Latest Updates The Green Ammonia & Melamine Projects: In February 2023, the company signed an agreement to produce green ammonia

intrinsically tied to both global and subsidized urea prices, in conjunction with a proportion of their export and domestic sales. Notably, MFPC stands out among other local peers due to the absence of a price floor for its gas cost formula. This unique advantage positions MFPC favorably during periods of urea price decline, leading to improved gross profit margins. Commitment to Local Market Requirement: As required by the Egyptian government from fertilizer producers, MFPC is required to allocate 55% of its production output to the government, offered at a low compulsory procurement price. In return, it is allowed to sell 45% of its production at the free market price, either in the domestic or international market. In the last reported fiscal year FY22, it is important to highlight from green hydrogen in cooperation with the leading company in the field of green energy solutions, the Norwegian Scatec. In addition, MFPC is also seeking to establish a melamine factory in the Damietta Free Zone. However, the specifics surrounding the investment magnitude, financing method, and prospective production are still unknown due to limited disclosures. MFPC has stated that a full disclosure of the specifics of both projects will be provided once the feasibility studies have been concluded. Merge Coupled with Stock Split: In a recent move, MFPC has undertaken a merger with ENPC, a company in which it holds a 99.9% stake. This merger was accompanied by a stock split, wherein each pre-merger MFPC share is equivalent to 9.1

that MFPC demonstrated a commitment to its mandated local sales, selling 55% of its total production locally. High Exports Revenue Stream: The company exports 45% of its urea production, especially to Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and North America. The remaining 55% is sold locally at the government's low compulsory procurement price of EGP4500/ton. In 2022, the company's export sales reached EGP13.3bn, accounting for approximately 70% of the overall sales revenue. This substantial contribution from export sales is poised to provide a financial cushion for the company in future periods, particularly in light of the potential EGP shares post-merger, leading to a decrease in MFPC's share price by approximately the same ratio. Additionally, MFPC's paid-in capital increased from EGP2.29bn to EGP20.79bn postmerger. It is important to note that this increase does not signify an actual inflow of new capital. Rather, it is an accounting adjustment that involves shifting from other equity accounts, primarily accumulated from the conversion of ENPC's foreign currency financials, to the paid-in capital account. We see that this move appears to offer only marginal value to MFPC, considering that it already holds a 99.9% ownership stake in ENPC.

Valuation & Recommendation We valued MFPC using our DCF based model. Our value is based on a declining Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) over our forecast horizon. The FY24 WACC of 31.9% is calculated based on (1) US 5Y Treasury yield of 3.8%, (2) an inflation differential factor of 1.25, (3) EGY 1Y CDs spread of 4.12%, (4) matured market equity risk premium ERP of 3.16%, and (5) 5Y Beta of 1.05. We expect a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. We reach a fair value of EGP33.95/share, which implies a downside potential of 57% based on MFPC's last close price. Based on that, we issue a Sell recommendation for MFPC stock. Misr Fertilizers Production (Mopco)

### Egyptian Chemical Industries (Kima)

Business Summary Egyptian Chemical Industries "Kima" is a subsidiary of the Chemical Industries Holding Company. It is a key player in the nitrogen fertilizer sector, relying on power from the hydroelectric station of the Aswan Dam. Kima's product portfolio includes a diverse range of fertilizers, chemicals, and associated products, with a particular emphasis on the production of urea and ammonium nitrates. The Kima 2 factory has an annual production capacity of approximately 570k tons of urea and 435k tons of ammonia, which is primarily utilized as an intermediate product. On the other hand, the Kima 1 factory is currently undergoing maintenance, resulting in limited production output of ammonium nitrates. However, upon resumption of full operations, it is projected to yield about 300k tons annually. EGCH Operation New Gas Formula Impact: Similar to other fertilizers producers, EGCH previously received natural gas at a subsidized fixed rate until the recent decision by the Ministry of Petroleum to transition to a new pricing formula linked to export urea prices. This placed downward strain on EGCH profit margins, which were more favorable under the previous subsidized fixed price. In addition, the proportion of export sales also plays a role in gas pricing. As EGCH's export sales grow as a percentage of its total revenue, its cost of gas also increases proportionally.

Export Revenue Stream & USD-Denominated Debt: As required by the Egyptian government, EGCH is obligated to allocate 55% of its production output to the government at a low compulsory procurement price. In the previous fiscal year FY22/23, EGCH only provided 30% of its output at this low price. This situation has positioned EGCH to capitalize on export revenue streams denominated in USD. We anticipate that this trend will persist in the forthcoming periods,

supporting the company's profitability, particularly in light of the potential EGP devaluation. Additionally, this revenue stream could be utilized to service its debt, which is predominantly denominated in USD.

Future Expansion: Nitric Acid & Ammonium Nitrate Project Project Details: On 28 December 2023, EGCH revealed that it has paid the down payment on the Nitric Acid & Ammonium Nitrate project from the company's own resources. The payment represents 25% of the USD component of the total investment cost, in addition to 20% of the EGP component. The project is expected to yield an annual production of 600k tons of ammonium nitrate and to be implemented in 3 years, with a mutually agreed investment cost of USD297mn, with USD234mn to be paid in USD and the balance in EGP. Financial Strain: While the project is anticipated to enhance EGCH's value in the long term, it is expected to exert substantial strain on the company's finances throughout the implementation phase. This is primarily due to the fact that the majority of the project's costs are denominated in USD, which could intensify the existing pressure on the company's USD denominated debt. It is expected that EGCH will resort to increased borrowing as well as raising additional capital to finance this project. Recent Development: EGCH announced on 31 January 2024 that it will work with ICON India to perform technical studies and design the product development process (PDP) for

reviving its ammonium nitrate line and upgrading the final product storage facilities. This comes as part of a new project to build additional units for nitric acid and ammonium nitrate production. This move demonstrates EGCH's commitment to its expansion plans, which will increase its capacity and competitiveness in the market.

### Egyptian Chemical Industries (Kima)

Valuation & Recommendation We valued EGCH using our DCF based model. Our value is based on a declining Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) over our forecast horizon. The 23/24 WACC of 23.0% is calculated based on (1) US 5Y Treasury yield of 3.8%, (2) an inflation differential factor of 1.21, (3) EGY 6M CDs spread of 5.39%, (4) matured market equity risk premium ERP of 3.16%, and (5) 5Y Beta of 1.17. We expect a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. We reach a fair value of EGP10.43/share, which implies a downside potential of -24% based on EGCH's
