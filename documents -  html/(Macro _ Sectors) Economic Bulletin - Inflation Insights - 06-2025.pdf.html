   Inflation for May25 came in at 1.9% MoM, considerably higher than last month's 1.3% MoM. F&amp;B was the leading contributor to this month's inflation, adding 0.59ppt and responsible for about a third of the reading. The Health category also had a substantial contribution of 0.43ppt, constituting almost a quarter of this month's inflation figure. In third place was transportation with second round effects from last month's fuel price hike, adding 0.27ppt. This was followed by a seasonal participant in the top contributors list, the Recreation category. This contributed 0.21ppt, likely driven by higher prices of Hajj pilgrimages.

   The level of annual inflation for May25 jumped to 16.8% YoY from 13.9% YoY the previous month. The breakdown of contributions to the annual figure reveals that over a quarter of this month's inflation can be attributed to F&amp;B, which added 4.5ppt to the total. The Health category continues to make large contributions to annual inflation, rising a considerable 42% YoY and pitching in 3.0ppt to annual inflation in May25. Transportation has also been a major contributor, also rising 42% YoY but adding a smaller 2.5ppt due to the varying weights of different categories in the CPI basket. Housing &amp; Utilities also had a notable role with a 1.8ppt contribution on rent and utilities increases.

    F&amp;B Category:
   </i>
   Monthly inflation for the F&amp;B category came in at 1.5% MoM in May25. This resulted in it being the largest contributor to the monthly CPI figure, adding 0.59ppt to the 1.9% MoM reading. The main contributor to monthly F&amp;B inflation was Fruits, with Dairy and Seafood showing interesting movements.

  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Fruits Sub-Category:
   </i>
   The prices of Fruits shot up again in May25 by a substantial 14.1% MoM. This comes after significant deflation of -12.2% MoM last month, with May25 more than recouping these price drops. While this sub-category is understandably volatile mostly due to seasonality, it seems to have been affected by second-round effects from the fuel price hikes implemented last month. The Fruits sub-category contributed 0.70ppt to the F&amp;B category's 1.5% MoM increase in May25. Annually, inflation in this sub-category remains highly elevated at 61.8% YoY.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Dairy Sub-Category:
   </i>
   Dairy prices dropped significantly in May25, posting deflation of -2.8% MoM. Last month had also shown deflation of -0.5% MoM. Dairy prices had also dropped -3.9% MoM in May24. Modest monthly gains along the LTM have seen annual Dairy inflation drop from 40.0% YoY this time last year down to just 5.0% YoY in May25.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Seafood Sub-Category:
   </i>
   The Seafood sub-category saw the second-highest F&amp;B price gains this month, rising 2.4% MoM. This follows last month's similar increase of 2.7% MoM. Seafood prices were flat during most of the winter and coming into spring, but have begun posting noticeable gains recently. Annual Seafood inflation has risen from an LTM low of 6.3% YoY to 12.5% YoY in May25, after having dropped from an LTM high of 25.8% YoY in Oct24.

    Monthly F&amp;B

   inflation recorded 1.5% MoM in May25, reversing the deflation witnessed last month of -1.5% MoM. This followed the sharp spike in Mar25 of 3.5% MoM from the surge in Ramadan F&amp;B demand. The constant ups and downs in this category are customary, as it is highly volatile and subject to seasonality.

   Fruits &amp; Vegetables, a group of items that the CBE excludes from its Core Inflation index, witnessed an unusual price surge of 7.0% MoM in May25. This group's usual seasonal pattern sees prices rising around July of each year. Yet, it seems last month's fuel price increase has resulted in second-round effects on this group, which relies on fuel for its extensive transportation and some aspects of its production. Its annual inflation popped up to 32.1% YoY from last month's 21.0% YoY.

   The group of Regulated Items not included in the CBE's Core Inflation gauge rose moderately by 1.1% MoM from the month before. This comes after the LTM high surge last month of 4.0% MoM on the back of regulated items price increases. On an annual basis, it has been holding steady for four months in the range of 25.1-26.7% YoY, with May25 coming in at the top end of this range. It has also been relatively range bound throughout the LTM, hovering between 25.1-31.8% YoY.

     F&amp;B had the greatest impact on inflation, contributing 0.59ppt to the monthly CPI inflation reading of 1.9% MoM. Despite its relatively small price increase of 1.5% MoM compared to much larger increases in other categories, the huge weight that F&amp;B commands in the CPI index resulted in its contribution being the largest.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     The Health and Transportation categories had the second and third greatest contributions of 0.43ppt and 0.27ppt respectively. The categories saw notable price increases of 5.2% MoM and 3.9% MoM respectively.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     The largest monthly price increase was witnessed in the Recreation category, which saw its prices rise by 7.2% MoM. Although this is a big increase, probably attributable to higher prices of Hajj pilgrimage, it was the fourth-largest contributor to inflation with 0.21ppt.

   <b>
    Headline Inflation
   </b>
   refers to what CAPMAS officially labels as Urban Inflation. This represents the level of inflation in cities and urban areas, and excludes rural regions and any other areas. Along with Rural Inflation, they are both combined together in the broader Nationwide Inflation index. We only use Headline Inflation figures in any reference to inflation other than Core Inflation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Core Inflation
   </b>
   strips out the volatile components of the CPI, which are generally the two groups: Regulated Items and Fruits &amp; Vegetables (excluding pulses, processed vegetables, and dried fruits).
