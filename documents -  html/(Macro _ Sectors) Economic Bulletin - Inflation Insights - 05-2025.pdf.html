    Fuel Price Increase:
   </i>
   The regulated price of fuels was raised in  Apr25 by up to 15%. This resulted in an increase in the  Transportation category's inflation, which reached 9.9% MoM  and 37.4% YoY.

    Headline Drops but Core Rises:
   </i>
   There was a disparity between  the two inflation measures in Apr25. On a monthly basis,  Headline Inflation fell to 1.3% MoM in Apr25 from 1.7% MoM the  previous month. On the other hand, Core Inflation rose from  0.9% MoM in Mar25 to 1.2% MoM in Apr25. The difference is  mainly due to the decline in F&amp;B prices reducing Headline  Inflation.

  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Food Prices Drop:
   </i>
   The prices of the F&amp;B category dropped  substantially by -1.5% MoM. This resulted in a reduction in  monthly Headline Inflation of -0.61ppt.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Monthly inflation in Apr25 was pushed down by deflation in the F&amp;B category, which subtracted -0.61ppt from the reading. This relief for inflation came as F&amp;B prices dropped -1.5% MoM, driven by decreases in the prices of Meats and Fruits. The Apr25 reading was split into four equal parts, with F&amp;B the deflationary exception. The other two main drivers of monthly inflation were Transportation and Health, which each contributed 0.64ppt to the Apr25 print. These two categories say price increases of 9.9% MoM and 8.2% MoM, respectively. The contribution of all the remaining categories was 0.66ppt.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Apr25 saw annual inflation rise slightly to 13.9% YoY. The two main drivers were the F&amp;B and Health categories, with each contributing 2.5ppt to the annual reading. The combined contribution of these two categories represented over a third of the Apr25 annual inflation figure. These were followed closely by the Transportation category, which had a 2.2ppt contribution due to a substantial 37.4% YoY increase in its prices. This category has been affected by hikes in the prices of fuel and public transportation. After that was the Housing &amp; Utilities category, pitching in 1.7ppt. The remaining categories combined had a contribution of 5.1ppt.

    Monthly Health
   </b>
   inflation shot up significantly in Apr25 to reach 8.2% MoM, versus two previous months of low figures. Earlier months had witnessed repeated reported and planned increases in the regulated prices of pharmaceuticals. This might explain the jump this month, as well as potential increases in other medical products and supplies.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Annual Health
   </b>
   inflation surged again in Apr25 after two months of steep declines, which saw it drop from an LTM high of 43.1% YoY in Jan25 all the way down 25.4% YoY in Mar25. This month it jumped back up to 35.0% YoY.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Monthly Transportation
   </b>
   inflation surged again in Apr25 to hit 9.9% MoM, after four months of very low inflation. This is due to a hike of up to 15% in the regulated price of fuel, including gasoline and diesel used in transportation. The last fuel price increase was in Nov24, which raised this category's monthly inflation by 7.4% MoM.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Annual Transportation
   </b>
   inflation had been declining for the last four months, but picked up again in Apr25 to hit 37.4% YoY. This is the second highest figure in the LTM, with the highest reading of 38.1% YoY recorded in Nov24, having been the peak from which the last downtrend had begun. Transportation inflation has been taking big steps up every few months since at least Mar24's 16.2% YoY.

    F&amp;B Category:
   </i>
   In Apr25, the F&amp;B category saw strong monthly deflation of -1.5% MoM. This allowed it to relieve pressure of the Headline CPI reading, reducing it by -0.61ppt. This comes after an LTM high monthly inflation of 3.5% MoM last month. The same sub-categories that caused the sharp inflation last month are the ones that reversed course and saw significant price drops this month.

  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Fruits Sub-Category:
   </i>
   Fruits prices had skyrocketed last month by 34.9% MoM, only to drop back again substantially in Apr25 by -12.2% MoM. Although by nature a highly seasonal sub-category, the movements of the last couple of months are rather pronounced. The sharp drop in Apr25 pulled down annual Fruits inflation notably, lowering it to 61.8% YoY from 88.0% YoY last month, although still at unusually high levels.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Meats Sub-Category:
   </i>
   The Meats sub-category saw its prices fall by -3.1% MoM in Apr25 after rising 2.5% MoM last month. Although not the largest monthly deflation over the LTM, it breaks three previous consecutive months of notable price increases. On an annual basis, Meats have actually deflated marginally, recording -0.2% YoY. This comes after it had dropped significantly to below 1% YoY in the last two months, falling from 22.6% YoY in Jan25.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <i>
    Poultry Sub-Category Component:
   </i>
   The Poultry component of the Meats sub-category was mainly responsible for the drop in Meats prices. Poultry saw its prices drop by a substantial -7.3% MoM in Apr25 from 5.1% MoM inflation last month. Annually, Poultry prices have deflated by -3.1% YoY. This is the third month that annual Poultry inflation is in the negative, with last month recording -0.6% YoY and the previous month hitting -2.2% YoY.

    Monthly F&amp;B
   </b>
   inflation dropped significantly below zero, deflating by -1.5% MoM in Apr25. This is the fourth monthly deflationary reading over the LTM, in addition to deflation this time last year in Apr24 of -0.9% MoM. Apr25 is a sharp reversal from last month, when F&amp;B inflation spiked 3.5% MoM, an LTM high. The 3mo. MA indicates volatile data over the LTM, even with its smoothing effect.
   <b>
    Annual F&amp;B
   </b>
   inflation completed a steep disinflationary path over many months when it reached 3.7% YoY last Feb25. This time last year it was at 40.5% YoY, and this month it comes in at only 6.0% YoY, down from 6.6% YoY in Mar25.

   The Fruits &amp; Vegetables group that the CBE does not include in its Core Inflation gauge witnessed notable monthly deflation of -5.5% MoM in Apr25. A similar decline occurred in Feb25, although last month there was a sharp LTM high inflation of 17.9% MoM. The volatility of this category is evident in the ups and downs of the last few months. Annual Fruits &amp; Vegetables inflation dropped to 21.0% YoY in Apr25 from a much higher 30.8% YoY registered last month.

  <p block-type="Text">
   Regulated Items, the group that is not included in the CBE's Core Inflation, jumped to an LTM monthly high of 4.0% MoM. This could mostly be attributed to the increase in fuel prices. It comes after last month saw no inflation whatsoever in this group of items. On an annual basis, Regulated Items have leveled off for the last three months, coming in this month at 25.5% YoY. Over the LTM, this group of items has been hovering in the range of 25.1%-32.8% YoY.

     The Transportation and Health categories were both the ones that saw the largest price increases as well as the greatest contributors to monthly inflation in Apr25. These categories saw price increases over the month of 9.9% MoM and 8.2% MoM, respectively. This led them to contribute 0.64ppt each to monthly inflation.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     Although Hospitality had the third largest price increase of 3.5% MoM in Apr25, its small weight resulted in its contribution amounting to just 0.22ppt.

    <li block-type="ListItem">
     F&amp;B countered the price increases in the other categories with its price decline of -1.5% MoM, and when coupled with its heavy weight in the index, resulted in a negative contribution of -0.61ppt to monthly inflation in Apr25.

   <b>
    Headline Inflation
   </b>
   refers to what CAPMAS officially labels as Urban Inflation. This represents the level of inflation in cities and urban areas, and excludes rural regions and any other areas. Along with Rural Inflation, they are both combined together in the broader Nationwide Inflation index. We only use Headline Inflation figures in any reference to inflation other than Core Inflation.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Core Inflation
   </b>
   strips out the volatile components of the CPI, which are generally the two groups: Regulated Items and Fruits &amp; Vegetables (excluding pulses, processed vegetables, and dried fruits).
