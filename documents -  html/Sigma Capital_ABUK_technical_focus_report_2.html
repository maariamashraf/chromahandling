   The stock price has experienced a sharp decline, breaking below the lower boundary of the sideways trend it was following and trading below the important support level of EGP 59.50.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   If this downward break is confirmed, it is recommended to activate a stop-loss order. A break below this level would signal a short-term bearish trend, paving the way for further declines with an initial target around the 48.00 EGP support area.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   This bearish outlook will remain in place as long as the stock trades below the first resistance level, which now represents a potential pivot point for a reversal if it is broken upwards.
