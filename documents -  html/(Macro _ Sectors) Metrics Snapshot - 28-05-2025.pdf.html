   In this edition of the Metrics Snapshot, we conducted a thorough analysis of the top 5 EGX30 companies that outperformed the index, based on their 52-week returns. ISPH, RMDA, ORHD, PHDC, and HRHO were found to be the top EGX30 outperformers. Our analysis aimed to determine whether these stocks outperformed due to solid fundamentals or other factors. Our main metric was the TTM net profit YoY growth in 1Q25. We also used TTM revenue YoY growth to evaluate the topline performance, TTM cash conversion ratio to address the ability of these companies to translate their profits into actual cash, and TTM ROE to measure overall profitability.

    [FIG.1] 1Q25 TTM NET PROFIT YOY GROWTH
   </i>
   <b>
    ORHD
   </b>
   recorded both the highest TTM net profit YoY growth and the highest TTM net profit figure in 1Q25, both of which were significantly exceeding those of the rest of the sample.
   <b>
    ISPH
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    RMDA
   </b>
   followed with a 192% and 75% YoY growth, respectively. Despite reporting higher TTM net profits in 1Q25, both PHDC and HRHO saw their TTM net profit YoY growth fall below the sample median. However,
   <b>
    HRHO
   </b>
   witnessed a very low 6% YoY growth compared to the rest of the sample.
  </p>
  <h4>
   <i>
    [FIG.2] 1Q25 TTM REVENUE YOY GROWTH
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    ISPH
   </b>
   recorded both the highest TTM revenue YoY growth and the highest TTM revenue in 1Q25, with a revenue figure notably higher than the rest of the sample. Despite
   <b>
    RMDA
   </b>
   having the lowest TTM revenue in 1Q25, it ranked second in terms of YoY growth. Although ORHD, PHDC, and HRHO recorded similar revenue figures,
   <b>
    ORHD
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    PHDC
   </b>
   both matched the sample median of 45%, while
   <b>
    HRHO
   </b>
   recorded the lowest YoY growth of 14%.

  <h4>
   <i>
    [FIG.3] TTM CASH CONVERSION RATIO IN 1Q25
   </i>
  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The cash conversion ratio assesses the quality of a company's earnings by indicating how much of its reported profit is supported by actual cash generated from operations. A higher ratio signals healthier, more sustainable cash-backed profitability. In 1Q25,
   <b>
    PHDC
   </b>
   ranked highest across the sample, followed by
   <b>
    ORHD,
   </b>
   which was not far behind. While RMDA, ISPH, and HRHO recorded negative values,
   <b>
    RMDA
   </b>
   was in line with the sample median. In contrast,
   <b>
    HRHO
   </b>
   stood at -5.31x, significantly lower than the median.

  </h4>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    ORHD
   </b>
   recorded the highest TTM ROE in the sample for 1Q25 at 60%, which was significantly higher than the rest of the sample. ORHD's high ROE aligns with it recording the highest net profit figure across the sample.
   <b>
    ISPH
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    PHDC
   </b>
   followed at 37% and 28%, respectively. RMDA and HRHO posted ROEs of 21% and 11%, both below the sample median. However,
   <b>
    HRHO's
   </b>
   11% TTM ROE was considerably lower than the sample median, while
   <b>
    RMDA's
   </b>
   was somewhat closer to it.

  </h4>
  <p block-type="ListGroup">
   <ul>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      ORHD
     </b>
     ranked highest in both TTM net profit YoY growth and TTM ROE in 1Q25. It also recorded moderate TTM revenue YoY growth and ranked second in TTM cash conversion ratio. These metrics suggest that ORHD was a strong EGX30 performer, supported by growing, cash-backed earnings. Additionally, it is trading at a low P/E ratio, which may indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its earnings potential.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      ISPH
     </b>
     ranked highest in TTM revenues and second highest in both TTM net profit YoY growth and TTM ROE in 1Q25. However, it ranked second lowest in TTM cash conversion ratio, suggesting that its net profit may not be fully supported by cash. ISPH is also trading at a relatively high P/E.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      PHDC
     </b>
     showed moderate results across most selected metrics and is also trading at a relatively low P/E, suggesting the stock may be undervalued and could have further potential.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     While
     <b>
      RMDA
     </b>
     had the second highest TTM revenue YoY growth, it is trading at a relatively high P/E compared to its TTM ROE within the sample.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     <b>
      HRHO
     </b>
     lagged behind all metrics in the sample and is trading at a moderate P/E, but it has the lowest TTM ROE.
