      The stock price is trading in a short-term
      <br/>
      downtrend. The price fell from its previous peak
      <br/>
      of EGP 86.75 , which stopped the previous
      <br/>
      corrective rise and signaled the reemergence of
      <br/>
      selling pressure.
      <br/>
      •
      <br/>
      The price continued to fall and managed to break
      <br/>
      down below the secondary support level of EGP
      <br/>
      83.00 , signaling the end of the upward
      <br/>
      corrective move and the resumption of the
      <br/>
      downtrend.
      <br/>
      •
      <br/>
      The first support level lies at the previous bottom
      <br/>
      at the EGP 71.00 support area. If it breaks down
      <br/>
      below, it will pave the way for further declines
      <br/>
      towards the EGP 66.00 support area.
      <br/>
      •
      <br/>
      This negative view will remain in place as long as
      <br/>
      we trade below the resistance level of EGP 85.00,
      <br/>
      which has become a re-entry level if it breaks up.
