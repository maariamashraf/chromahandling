   Event Note 8 April 2025
  </h3>
  <p block-type="Text">
   After the sharp drop in inflation witnessed in February 2024 on base effects, the CBE is in a position to  potentially begin an easing cycle from the currently elevated policy rates. In the event that the CBE lowers  interest rates, there will be varied effects on companies listed on the EGX. With most of corporate debt  interest rates linked to the CBE's policy rates, the companies with higher debt loads stand to benefit  through lower interest expenses.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   From an overall market perspective, lower rates in the economy have a dual effect. One result is that they  reduce the attractiveness of saving, including in the popular high-yield CDs (Certificates of Deposit),  thereby encouraging alternative investments such as in equity markets. Another outcome is that they  lower borrowing costs for companies, thereby encouraging capital investments and expansionary  corporate strategies. In this report we describe the potential impacts of a reduction in the CBE's policy  rates on some of the largest companies on the EGX.

      • Although the interest rate cuts are expected to adversely impact CIB's NIMs and
      <br/>
      profitability. However, the bank's approach of locking in high-yield long-term
      <br/>
      bonds at the expense of short-term treasuries mitigates and delays that impact.
      <br/>
      • Additionally, CIB's strong CAR (c.24.1%), low GLDR (c.40.3%), and emphasis on
      <br/>
      corporate lending (c.80% of loan portfolio) position the bank well to expand its
      <br/>
      LCY lending activities.
      <br/>
      • Moreover, CIB's cheap funding mix (CASA stands at c.55%), proactive rate cuts
      <br/>
      on certain CDs ahead of the CBE's decision, coupled with our projected cautious
      <br/>
      and gradual decline in interest rates, would lead to a relatively slower and
      <br/>
      steadier profit normalization.

      <br/>
      the coming period, thus alleviating pressure on profitability.
      <br/>
      • On the other hand, ADIB's relatively low CAR (c.17.2%) may pose challenges to its
      <br/>
      growth during the forthcoming monetary easing cycle.

      the bank's high GLDR (c.58%) and its relatively low market share constrain its

      <br/>
      • The EGP-denominated portion of cash and equivalents, far exceeding the EGP

      denominated portion of debt, heightens TMG's exposure to adverse effects on
      <br/>
      net interest income from the anticipated CBE interest rate cuts.

      • TMG reported a net finance income of EGP456mn, equivalent to a modest 3% of

      EBT, with a very minimal impact on the company's overall profitability for FY24.

      • Looking ahead, we expect TMG to reallocate a portion of its excess cash to its
      <br/>
      capex and development projects rather than interest-bearing securities.
      <br/>
      • Taking these factors into account, while interest rate cuts may negatively affect

      anticipate a neutral overall impact on the company's profitability.
