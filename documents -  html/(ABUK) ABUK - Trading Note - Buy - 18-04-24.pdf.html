   year, when there was an exceptional spike in global  Beneficiary in the case of raising the subsidized urea price: In light of the recent EGP devaluation, fertilizer manufacturers have proposed a revision of the mandatory procurement price of urea from the current EGP4,500/ton. The devaluation has significantly escalated production costs, a situation compounded by the concurrent surge in the free market price of urea to EGP20,000/ton. In our assessment, the adjustment in the subsidized urea price by the government would be beneficial to ABUK, considering that the company is required to supply 55% of its production at subsidized rates to the Ministry of Agriculture. Primary beneficiary of the recent EGP devaluation and interest rate hike: Considering recent economic developments, ABUK, being debt-free and holding excess cash, stands to gain from the interest rate hike, as they recorded a return on treasury bills of EGP1.2bn in FY22/23. Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture may not receive the full 55% quota; hence, the company has the capacity to increase exports beyond 45% of its production, thereby capitalizing on the EGP devaluation. Additionally, the company recorded an FX gain of EGP3.9bn in FY22/23.

     previous peak of EGP69.50.  This breakout was accompanied by high trading volumes and confirmed by many technical indicators. • A downward corrective move is currently underway as the price retests the broken-out area, which has now turned into a support zone. • We recommend buying at this support level. • We expect buying power to reappear and push the price towards its next target at the strong resistance level of EGP81.00. • We will maintain a positive outlook as long as the price remains above the stop-loss level.
