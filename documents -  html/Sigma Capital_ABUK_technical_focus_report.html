   The weekly chart above shows ABUK price performance on the medium term is moving in an up trend. It witnessed a strong up move after breaking the previous peak at 53.20 EGP achieving new historical level as it reached the strong resistance area of 68.00 EGP. This area represents a strong resistance as it coincides with 423.6 % of the Fibonacci retracement levels of the upside leg between points 0%&amp; 100% on the above chart and it is testing the upward channel line which acts as moving resistance as the prices declined 6 times from this line. Also we see many bearish signals on the technical indicators as it reached an overbought area which is illustrated by the vertical lines on the above chart, where the share price has declined from it previously. We recommend profit taking around this area . The probability of declining from this area and witnessing some correction is high , targeting the mentioned supports levels. On the other hand, the relative performance compared to the EGX30 index is outperforming . This bearish scenario is valid as long as the price below the strong resistance level EGP 70.00.
