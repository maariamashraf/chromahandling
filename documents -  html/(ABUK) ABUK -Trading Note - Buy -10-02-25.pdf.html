    ABUK Reports Strong Financial Results in 1H24/25 YoY &amp; QoQ:
   </b>
   The company's revenues increased by 19% YoY to reach EGP10.2bn, with a significant quarterly growth rate of 83%. This strong YoY growth is mainly attributed to the improvement in average urea selling prices. The quarterly growth is attributed to the inherent seasonality in this sector, as 1Q24/25 saw urea prices decline due to low demand, creating a low base effect that contributed to this high QoQ growth in 2Q24/25. Notably, the company's profitability margins improved on a quarterly basis in 2Q24/25, driven by the growth in sales led by the average urea selling prices growth, coupled with stable gas supplies.

   is progressing with the implementation of various projects that will drive its future growth, including a solar energy project and a partial replacement of natural gas with green hydrogen. These projects will help in maintaining ABUK's market share in Europe, the primary export destination, as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) approaches implementation in 2026. The successful execution of these projects will support the sustainability of the company's export revenues.
