  <p block-type="Text">
   In this edition of the Metrics Snapshot, we analyzed the main F&amp;B and pharma companies to assess their reliance on debt-financed assets using our primary metric, Debt-to-Equity, and its impact on profitability. To support this analysis, we chose three supporting ratios: (1) TTM Interest Coverage ratio to evaluate a company's ability to cover interest expenses through operations, (2) TTM Net Debt to EBITDA to assess a company's ability to pay off its debt using its operations, and (3) EBITDA Margin to determine each company's operational profitability. Our sample includes
   <b>
    OLFI
   </b>
   ,
   <b>
    EFID
   </b>
   ,
   <b>
    JUFO
   </b>
   , and
   <b>
    DOMT
   </b>
   . For the pharma sector, we chose
   <b>
    PHAR
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    RMDA
   </b>
   . We excluded
   <b>
    ISPH
   </b>
   as it has a different business model from
   <b>
    PHAR
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    RMDA

   In 1Q25, among the F&amp;B sector,
   <b>
    DOMT
   </b>
   holds the highest Debt-to-Equity, reflecting its higher reliance on debt in financing its assets. Meanwhile,
   <b>
    JUFO
   </b>
   has the lowest Debt-to-Equity, showcasing its lower reliance on debt. In the pharma sector,
   <b>
    PHAR
   </b>
   stands out with a higher Debtto-Equity than
   <b>
    RMDA
   </b>
