    Flash Note l Egypt hikes gas prices for industrial sector
   </b>
  </h1>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    The answer was "NO":
   </b>
   We recall that we inquired in our research report dated 30 September 2021 named "Will the Egyptian government continue to subsidize the industrial sector?" about the
   <a href="https://www.sigma-cap.com/main/RESEARCH_M_D.download?res_code_p=3&amp;res_name_p=Flash Note-Will the Egyptian government continue to subsidize the industrial sector.pdf&amp;company_p=EGS38191C010&amp;res_date_p=30-SEP-21">
    government's
   </a>
   willingness to continue to subsidize the industrial sector. We got the answer for our inquiry on 28 October 2021, after the Energy Pricing Committee of the cabinet decided to increase natural gas prices by USD 1.25/mmbtu (+27.8% to USD 5.75 up from USD 4.5/mmbtu) for cement, steel, fertilizers and petrochemicals sectors, effective from 1 November 2021. Based on the government's decision, there will be an exception for the companies that pay via a formula like Misr Fertilizers Production Co.- MOPCO (MFPC.CA) and Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals (SKPC.CA).
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Who will be negatively impacted by the decision?
   </b>
   We believe that heavy users of natural gas who will be negatively affected by the decision as follows:
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   (1)
   <b>
    Steel producers
   </b>
   (Ezz steel (ESRS.CA) and Al Ezz Dekheila Steel - Alexandria (IRAX.CA)),(2)
   <b>
    Fertilizers producers
   </b>
   (Abu Qir Fertilizers (ABUK.CA), and Egyptian Chemical Industries - Kima (EGCH.CA)) will be negatively impacted by the mentioned decision, as both companies used to receive their natural gas (feedstock) at a fixed quota of USD 4.5/mmBtu before the recent decision. Under the new decision, ABUK and Kima are going to get their feedstock at a fixed quota of USD 5.75/mmBtu, implying a 15% cut in our FV for Abu Qir.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    The government decision has no impact on MOPCO, SKPC and cement sector:
   </b>
   We believe that MOPCO and Sidi Kerir Petrochemicals will not be negatively impacted by the decision. MOPCO receives its natural gas (feedstock) at a pricing formula, where the cost is correlated with the global urea price. Moreover, SKPC uses ethane and propane mixture as its feedstock provided by Egyptian Natural Gas Company (GASCO) at a pricing formula, which correlates with the global Polyethylene and Ethylene prices.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   Furthermore, there will be no impact on cement producers as they are currently using coal as an alternative to natural gas. In September 2021, cement companies were seeking to return to operating with natural gas fuels (to benefit from its low price at USD 4.5/ mmBtu during that time compared to coal) instead of coal, after nearly seven years of the government's decision to compel companies to use a mixture of fuels from coal and waste.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Egypt to benefit from higher gas prices globally:
   </b>
   In our view, Egypt's budget should benefit from the natural gas prices' increases globally, as the country is currently an exporter for natural gas. Moreover, Egypt should benefit from selling its natural gas in the spot market which should support Egypt's export proceeds.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   The Egyptian government had increased its gas exports to global markets to benefit from the gas shortage in Europe. According to Reuters, the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) announced that Egypt exported around 4.3 million ton of liquefied natural gas in 9M21, up from 0.45 million ton a year earlier. It is worth noting that Egypt was an importer for gas before discovering huge reserves of natural gas in Zohr field. The country achieved self- sufficiency in natural gas consumption in September 2018 due to the gradual increase in local production.
  </p>
  <p block-type="Text">
   <b>
    Will the CBE raise interest rates due to higher inflation?
   </b>
   On the inflation front, we believe that inflation rate will continue to increase over the coming period to reflect the expected hike in raw materials and commodities' prices following to the recent decision to hike gas prices for industrial sector. This can be attributed to the fact that most probably manufactures and producers will pass on the recent increase in natural gas price to the final consumers which should push the inflation rate up. Finally, we believe that if the inflation rate level extremely surpassed the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)'s target, the CBE may tend to increase interest rates to support the household sector.
