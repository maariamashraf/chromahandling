    Drop in FX Gains Weighs on Margins:
   </b>
   While Abu Qir reported a 20% YoY revenue rebound in 9M24/25, both gross and net profit margins declined, mainly due to a sharp drop in FX gains. In prior periods, export-driven currency gains had significantly boosted NPM above GPM, but the recent drop in FX income has narrowed that spread, highlighting a return to core-operational profitability dynamics.

   <b>
    Gradual Restart Following Gas Resumption:
   </b>
   Abu Qir has been gradually restarting its production units as natural gas supply normalizes after temporary disruption linked to the Iran-Israel conflict. The restoration mitigates operational pressure and supports volume recovery for the coming quarters.

    10% Stake in Phosphoric Acid Project:
   </b>
   The Board approved a 10% equity stake in the Abu Tartour Phosphoric Acid Company, post-merger with El Wadi Phosphate. The USD643mn project, with a 3-year timeline and 250kt annual capacity, will be financed via shareholder loans. This supports ABUK's downstream expansion and long-term value creation.

     The stock price witnessed a strong rise during  yesterday's session, successfully breaking above  the upper boundary of its prevailing sideways  trend by overcoming the EGP51.00 resistance  zone.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     This breakout was accompanied by significant  trading volumes and confirmed by numerous  technical indicators, signaling a shift to a shortterm bullish trend.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     Consequently, we recommend a buy, as we  anticipate its continued ascent, targeting at least  the strong resistance area of EGP56.00.
    </li>
    <li block-type="ListItem">
     This positive technical outlook will remain valid  as long as the stock price trades above the  designated stop-loss level.
